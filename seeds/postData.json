Its aim is to increase the farmerâ€™s ability to keep contact with individual animals as livestock production intensifies. Using smart farming techniques, farmers can better monitor the needs of individual animals and adjust their management practices accordingly, thereby preventing health, welfare and management issues and enhancing herd health. A wide range of smart farming technologies is available that could be used in the swine industry, particularly sensing and monitoring technologies such as accelerometers, pressure mats and force plates, microphones, cameras and radio frequency identification (RFID).",
